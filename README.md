# Serverless-Web-Application-in-AWS
 The project involved creating a serverless web app on AWS. Amazon S3 stored static files with hosting enabled. API Gateway managed requests, directing them to Lambda for backend processing. DynamoDB stored data from HTML forms. IAM handled resource access, and CloudWatch monitored resources.
